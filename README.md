# Horiseon

## Description
This is the Horiseon project, modified for the Horiseon marketing agency. They requested help to make it fully functional and more search opitimal. The hyperlink at the top of the webpage wasn't working when clicked, it was supposed to jump to the "search engine optimization" article on the middle of the page. I wanted to help modify this website for them. I love diving in to projects, and with me being new to web development, I felt this was the perfect spot to start. The things I changed on the html file: the title, semantic elements, functionality, the flow, and tags.

    * The title was website, I changed it to the title of the company.
    * The semantic elements I changed in the html file were: header, nav, section, article, aside, and the footer. This also helped with the flow and helped describe areas.
    * I created an id attribute to link the hyperlink above to the article it belonged too.
    * I cleaned it up, changed a h3 tag to an h4 tag in the footer, changed some of the classes and deleted some of the classes. Since I changed the semantics which already was described.

The properties I changed in the CSS extension: header, grouped elements together, and updated the classes. 

    * I made sure to change the class header. Also, changed the div to nav. 
    * I linked together selector elements. 
    * Changed the classes that I updated. 

I learned alot from this project: semantics of a webpage, how id attributes help link to different spot on a page, how the html should flow, how css selectors can be grouped, and how to deploy a webpage. 
Mine stands out because I put extra time in my comments. 

## Usage
